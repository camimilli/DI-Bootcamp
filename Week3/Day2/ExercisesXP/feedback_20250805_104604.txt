suggestions for improvement:
- Add docstrings to the `__init__` method explaining the purpose of each parameter.
- Consider adding input validation to the `__init__` method to ensure that age and weight are positive numbers.  This would improve the robustness of the class.

suggestions for improvement:
- Add docstrings to the `Family` class methods for better readability and understanding.
- Consider adding error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) to handle potential exceptions, such as invalid input types for age.
- The `check_majority` method could be improved by returning a boolean value instead of printing the message. This would allow for more flexibility in how the result is handled by the calling code.
