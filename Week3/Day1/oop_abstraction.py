# ABSTRACTION = Hiding of information and giving access only when needed, prevents direct changes on attributes/methods.
# Python doesn't have a way to define private attributes, it uses name convention and name mangling. 
#   Single underscore prefix (_) - Indicates an attribute/method should be treated as "protected" or "internal" - hints other programmers 
# that they shouldn't access it directly from outside the class but Python will not stop them if they do.

#   Double underscore prefix (__) - Stronger convention that uses name mangling to make the attribute harder to access accidentally. It changes the name of the attribute/method
# behind the scene so when calling for the method/attribute causes an error because the attribute/method is not found (as the name was "changed") but can be worked around if you know the mangling name.
