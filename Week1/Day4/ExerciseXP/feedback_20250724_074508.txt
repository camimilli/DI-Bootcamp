suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, instead of commenting out the code,  provide a more informative explanation about the immutability of tuples.  You could add a `try...except` block to demonstrate the error.
- In Exercise 10, the loop for creating finished sandwiches is unnecessarily complex. A simpler `for` loop would suffice.
- Exercise 10's `while` loop is not optimal for removing 'Pastrami'. Consider using a `while` loop to iteratively remove until no 'Pastrami' remains.
- In Exercise 8, improve the user experience by explicitly handling cases where the user enters invalid inputs.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements the functionalities described in most exercises (Exercises 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). However, Exercise 2 lacks a complete demonstration of tuple immutability and Exercise 10 has a slightly inefficient implementation. Exercise 9's bonus is correctly implemented.  All exercises directly relate to the chapter content.
- readability: The code is mostly readable, with clear variable names and well-structured code blocks.  There's room for improvement in Exercise 10's while loop structure, and comments in Exercise 2 would enhance readability.
- performance: The code generally has good performance.  The only slightly suboptimal area is Exercise 10's `while` loop for creating finished sandwiches.
- security: The code doesn't have any security vulnerabilities as it only deals with user input that is not directly processed for sensitive operations or external data sources.
