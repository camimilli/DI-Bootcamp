This is because it's easier to see a big change in a small group of people, think about someone that robbed a bank in broad daylight, you have so much evidence that you would only need one witness to lock the robber in jail, however, if the crime was stealing $5 from a cash register you would need to have more witnesses to probe the crime actually happened - the same with our AB test.\n",
